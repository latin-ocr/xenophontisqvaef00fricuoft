1) ‘If we suppose that the lllemorabilia uas the earlier work, it
certainly cannot be coneeiced why he should afterwards have made
such a miserable repetition of ‘what he had already written, and added
only such thinys as must have been known to everybody! 1.1. p. 227.

2) ‘Surely this sentence [γεγράφασι μὲν οὖν κτλ] shews that a
considerable time must have intervened between the death of Socrates
(md the composition of the Apoloyy, and that the author ofthe latter
had no personal lsnoa’ledye of the death of Socrates, but that he had
derived his information from boohs. He infers, from the ayreement
of all the authorities which he consulted, that Socrates had actually
been yuilty of somethiny which he calls μεγαληγορία, and which he
proposes to captain. Xenophon could not have used such a phrase,
(md *zi-e must conclude that, if there is any truth in the precediny
remarks, Xenophon is not the author of the Apoloyy? 1.1. p. 228.

3) The only point in which such imitators usually betray them-
selves is their rhetorical exaqyeration, by which they hope to improee
upon their oriyiiictls. Strony instances of such exayyeration occur in
the Apoloyy, in the specimens which the author furnishes of Socrates'
Δμεγαληγορία, aad nothing) is more natural than that a rhetorician,
hearing] of this μεγαληγορία, and incapable of understandiny the calm
diynity of Socrates, should eoeayyerate his quiet eonsciousness of in-
nocence, which we see in Plato's Apoloyy and in the Memorabilia,
into a declamation about his innocence and merits, and that he should
